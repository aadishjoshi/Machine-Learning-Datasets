"I had a minor fender bender last year when someone rear ended me at probably 5MPH as we were merging onto road. Their insurance GEICO paid $2,900 to repair my bumper at Caliber Collision in Burke VA. I went to trade it in and dealer ran a report, to my surprise it says the damage is structural. Dealer would not even trade my vehicle in. After submitting a claim along with the estimate of damage on their website and waiting 3 days for a response. They claim because the tow hitch pushed in the floorpan that they consider it structural and won't reverse their report."
I purchased a history report on a vehicle I planned on buying because it had a salvage title and I wanted to know if the frame was damaged. The report says structural damage but then says to have a mechanic check for possible frame damage. I only bought this report to know if the frame was damaged for sure or not. Tried to get a refund and they said no. Complete waste of money!
Carfax is a very useful site for car/suv searching. I found the car history to be of use in regards to accidents and such. I’m completely satisfied with the search information Carfax provides. I wish I had used it before for some previous purchases.
"I am a small pre-owned car dealer. At the time of the incident, I was paying Carfax approx. $300/$400 a month for their service. The car I bought was bought from a Chrysler Manufacture sale and had been in a minor front end collision. The paperwork from Chrysler showed where the damaged totaled just shy of $1,200. The car was announced at the sale with previous minor damage. $1,200 dollars these days is minor. Chrysler did not misrepresent the car. We were okay with what had happened. It was sold fixed and a detailed repair bill in hand. "
"Bought a used Honda CRV from an Acura Dealership, they showed me the CARFAX and it was owned by a woman who never drove it and it had 17,000 km on it. When I was looking for a new car one year later, the CARFAX said I was the THIRD Owner? I called the dealership back and they said they couldn't comment on something that happened a year ago. What??? Then I spoke to him later on and he said he just doesn't understand what happened but that maybe it was a lease situation. What does that mean, and he did not know."
Purchased a vehicle with a Carfax report which indicated no structural damage. 4 months after I purchased it I tried to trade for another. The report output 4 months later indicated structural damage to the vehicle occurred 8 months prior to my purchase. When I questioned Carfax via online chat the representative essentially responded that it is not their problem and I should seek out a 3rd party resolution service or check with my state's DMV about disclosure laws.
My 2014 370z Nissan was in car accident on 06/27/2018. My Carfax says structural damage on 06/29/2018. My car title say none on the car salvage. I would like this mistake on my Carfax corrected. It should read total loss not structural damage. Please correct my Carfax as it should read Total Loss of vehicle 2014 Nissan 370z.
"I have used this business and paid for services, and also disputed their results both as a car seller and buyer. They are at best inconsistent. Their claim to fame is collecting data from department of motor vehicles; however when questioned, on their buyback guarantee then they can't be sure of the validity of their sources. On top that their consumer affairs after reneging on their buyback policy, because my car was listed as a 1 owner, lease; when the registration I have in my possession, says it was a RENTAL/FLEET VEHICLE. Completely different animal when CARFAX claims that it was a clean car, when it was a MANUFACTURER BUYBACK, THAT WAS THEN AUCTIONED OFF TO ONE OF ITS CERTIFIED CHEVY DEALERS to sell a car that was damaged, with no predelivery checks as documented a requirement by CHEVY; and manufacturer then refusing to fix vehicle under warranty because of fleet status."
"I was sold a vehicle that was one of their certified vehicles (a Land Rover Discovery Sport that had been wrecked). I had the vehicle inspected after arriving back in Santa Fe, the car is black but dark blue replacement parts along with black parts that were painted and not matching the original body color. The dealership has been informed but they will not correct any of the problems. Carfax is a total lie. My opinion, they are crooks!"
"My son purchased a used F250 truck in Texas. The Carfax was clean. It reported one owner. We thought we had a good truck. It was very evident it was in a flood. The Carfax did not report this. He was going to purchase another used truck. Same thing, clean Carfax and the two trucks we looked at were from Houston and were flood trucks. Buyer beware, Carfax does not report this."
"Bought a 2014 slightly used car in 2014 with 5000 miles on it. Carfax was clear of ANY damage. I was gonna trade it in in 2018 but was told the car had been wrecked according to Carfax. So at some point AFTER I received the clean Carfax these idiots marked my car as wrecked with safety concerns by the 1st owner. I had no option but to let them take it to auction. The money I would have used to trade with is now gone. Carfax can take their so called service and stick it. It is worthless, I will refuse to use their crap service. There are other services out there. How they are still the go to for car reports is freaking ridiculous."
"I just learned that a common scam with Carfax is reporting accidents that never happened. We are trying to trade in our 2018 Kia Sorrento. It is a lease car. Like so many others, that’s when we found out Carfax shows it has been in an accident. This is completely false information. About three months ago, my husband called me at work to make sure I was alright because our insurance contacted him about an accident claim. The supposed accident happened in a town two hours away. I told my husband that I was at work, and walked out and snapped a photo of our car in the parking lot. The insurance company questioned us...how did they know we hadn’t rushed and repaired the car, they asked my husband. Are you kidding? How did they know it was in an accident...there were no photos, no police report, basically no proof. "
"Carfax can only tell you what they are told by car dealers... For example; dealer reports that vehicle had to have an electrical check when in reality the system shorted out. But they don't tell Carfax that. Dealers were, and are what they will always be; sneaks. By looking at my vehicle report, you wouldn't recognize it as my car. Carfax did a good job but they can only report what they're told."
"Company is very expensive and does not have accurate information when it comes to used vehicles. They want you to pay big dollars to list your used cars for sale. I listed my brand new truck for sale with a clean title that I had, next thing you know I go online to look at my truck. The ad stated total loss vehicle. I had called Carfax. They had requested that I faxed my title to them. Lo and behold next day Carfax states they would not remove the total loss brand and they proceeded to state that you can still have a clean title and the vehicle be a total loss. Are you kidding me? This truck was never ever in a accident at all. Everyone be smart and save your money. Have your mechanic go over your next vehicle. Carfax is a 3rd party who knows nothing about used cars. They collect data that's all they do. Lotta times it's inaccurate. Beware Carfax is a Scam!!!! Be smart consumers. Save your money!!!"
"I opened a case (case no. **) with Carfax about a week ago when I was trying to sell my car and found out a damage reported on my car back in March 01, 2016. I leased out my 2015 Mazda CX-5 on Dec 6th 2014 from McDonald Mazda in CO and have been driving it since then. Serviced it on time every six months and kept it in meticulously. With growing family I planned to sell it and buy something bigger. To my surprise I found out a damage reported back in 2016. So I opened up a case with Carfax to which they responded that the report came from a trusted source and they cannot disclose who it is. All they can say is that it was a frontal damage and nothing else. They say ""Damage can be a result of many different types of events. Examples include contact with objects (other cars, trees, traffic signs, road debris, etc), vandalism, reconditioning, or weather-related events."""
"I have a 2013 Tacoma Prerunner. The top was damaged when a limb fell on it from a storm. I turned the claim into USAA insurance and had the work done by Caliber Collision on Atlantic Blvd in Jacksonville, Florida. The truck was returned to me and looked great. After a while I decided to upgrade to a new Tacoma. Imagine my surprise when I was told the Carfax stated that the vehicle had ""structural"" damage and that this would lower the value by $5000. After researching this I can not determine whom stated it had that damage. The repair facility claims they had not stated structural damage and USAA also claims they did not. No one wishes to accept responsibility for this and I just have to ""suck it up"". Let me explain, that when I feel put upon by a large company that will not ""do the right thing"" I become very determined. Should this not be corrected in what I feel is a reasonable amount of time it will escalate."
"My truck was hit in a parking lot. I have Geico Insurance and took it a Body Shop approved by Geico, ACE Auto Body, Fort Collins, CO. I went to sell the truck to Dellenbach Chevrolet in Fort Collins, CO. They showed us that on Carfax that it shows that my truck has Structural Damage. I called ACE and they claimed there is no Structural damage and they do not ever report anything to Carfax. I called Geico and they claim that they never report anything to Carfax. I notified Carfax and they claim that an entry (in their view is structural damage). "
I went on the website as a guest and requested a report for a vehicle. As soon as a put in the credit card information a error message came up. My card was charged immediately. I requested a refund and was never contacted. I chatted with a customer service rep because that was the only way they could be contacted which I think is inconvenient. They basically said they see the transaction but could like give the refund and the I needed to call my bank and the tech department.
"Carfax is the number one reporting tool used by all dealerships. As a monopoly they have a responsibility to report Accurate information. We purchased a vehicle with a clean Carfax so we thought. Until we brought it in as a trade in & were offered a 1/3 of its worth. Imagine our surprise when we were told the Jeep had two previous accidents & Carfax just started reporting them three months ago. The accidents happened back in 2013. I would have never made the purchase If the correct facts were reported. So, who regulates this dysfunctional company? Who is responsible for compensation against their negligence? Any guidance would be appreciated!"
Paid for report for 2008 Lexus RX400h. SAVE YOUR MONEY. No mention of repairs/parts replacements that 2 differently employed reputable mechanics said were replaced parts. This was battery for ABS system. Not a small replacement. No details about prior accident save date. Just a “nothing report”. Typical entry “vehicle serviced” with date. No details. Really. SAVE THE MONEY. DO NOT FALL PREY TO CARFAX $$ report. It is sooo NOT worth it.
"I was given notice that my Carfax report was updated and I decided to give it a look. I noticed several entries that were incorrect... Maintenance done and tire pressure checked in April 2018 at Ford dealer, mileage 65,201... Fast forward to November 2018, again I had service done at Ford dealer and mileage was 65,205, problem is my car was NOT at the dealer on those dates and did not have anything done by the dealer. I simply called about the airbag recall and somehow the dealer and Carfax turned that into false information. Hey, personally I don't mind all the ""free"" maintenance that shows up on my carfax report, but I would never EVER pay for a Carfax report as it is usually filled with wrong info."
"We applied to refinance our Dodge Challenger SRT, limited edition Plum Crazy Purple through our credit union. The loan application was quick and easy, but then we got notified by the other credit union that the pay-off check did not go through. We then called our credit union and asked why the pay-off check (after being approved) did not go through. They said it was their policy not to approved red flagged cars on Carfax report. Well we read the report which flagged our car as ""Severely damaged."" "
"The description of the Nissan Rogue I purchased through Carfax was not correct. Carfax said the mileage was 945, this turned out to be the last mileage on the last road trip the prev owner took. Also Carfax said there were no recalls. Turns out there is a major recall on this vehicle. I regret going thru Carfax. I have to make sure to get everything taken care of...unless I trade it in. Very disappointed with Carfax!!"
"I just got my truck out of the mechanic like 3 days ago. Running smooth. When I was driving to Carfax my husband and I were like wow, it’s running really smooth. Tell me why??? When we got it back drove back home because they offered us 1,000. It was making a funky sound. I really do think they did something to my truck. Oh and by the way they tried to say that the car had a accident in 2009. BS!"
"Accident was very minor... Someone clipped/tweaked the external hinge of my 2014 Ram Promaster's rear door. I filed an insurance claim. The insurance co. gave me a check for $675.00 to replace the hinge. Took the van to a dealer recently, contemplating a trade. Dealer runs a CarFax report which indicates ""Major front/side/rear damage""! I showed the dealer the hinge, but he still refused to believe me, and declined my trade. CarFax is nothing but inaccurate, unreliable information. Where is the class-action lawsuit?"
"Carfax information is not always correct. They said our vehicle had a serious accident in 2005. Because of their inaccurate information our trade in value went down to $500.00. When we tried to correct the error Carfax was of no help and we had to go out and try to find out where they got their information from. They do not have a phone number so you can not talk to a real person. I actually had to go on the internet to find out where this Bear Creek Township was where they said we had the accident. If you are buying a vehicle, selling one, or trading one in, do not believe the information you are given on their site. Beware of Carfax. You may not be given the correct information."
"I spend my money for an inaccurate report. The whole basis of your business is to give car buyers pertinent and reliable information in order to make an informed decision when buying a car. I purchased the car based on your report. After I purchased the car I ran the free VIN report and it contained 5 RECALLS which CARFAX listed NONE and a service call for transmission issue. It's also is NOT on CARFAX. I had to replace the entire transmission within 3 weeks. After spending several thousands of dollars on a new transmission and rental car, CARFAX didn't think that was worthy of a $60 refund. If you going to sell information you need to make sure it's accurate. Furthermore CARFAX is the most expensive VIN check report and the least accurate. I'm very disappointed."
"I have a truck with a ""clean"" title. Carfax reports it as a total loss. In order to submit a protest/complaint their form required me to agree to terms of service that gave up my rights to hold them responsible for errors. It is impossible to talk to them on the phone and the Chat service was a total waste. She just told me to submit a complaint. My experience is that CARFAX is unreputable and unreliable plus they have really bad customer service. I only gave them one star as it is not possible to give no stars."
"My vehicle has been meticulously maintained since it was purchased new in 2006. None of that information was reported in the ""Carfax"". When I sent them the copies of the service records I was told that the dealer that did the maintenance doesn't participate in the ""myCARFAX"" program therefore they were not authorized to include them in the report."
"Went to trade my F-150 and dealer pulls CarFfax and tells me it shows 11900 on a damage report. Damage was in fact 6109 and was only rear fender dent. Fender had to be replaced because it was rippled slightly. No structural damage, all cosmetic. I got the correct information from the insurer and sent it to Carfax to have the damage amended to the correct amount. They actually argued that the report only showed scratches and no major damage even though I had it right in front of me. 2 days worth of e-mails and 'help is on the way"" sent to me many times from them we are nowhere. "
"I bought an expensive used truck in July of 2017 with a clean one owner perfect Carfax. I had some service work done on the truck in August of 2018 and decided I might be considering trading it in for a different Model A year later only to find out that on the Carfax report it showed that there was ""damage"" to the rear from some unlisted source reported in July 2017 only 3 days after I bought my truck! When discovering this of course I thought it was a mistake but CarFax said no that the company that reported it just began to report these incidents in April of 2018 and so basically I'm out of luck and the value of my truck is less because of this information. "
"Jan. 2018 ordered one auto report, was charged for six. ($100). Made an email complaint (no phone contact possible) and was refunded the $60. Sept. 2018 ordered another single report and was billed for ($100). Made request and was refunded $60. This all came about because Carfax has you choose a single report but defaults to the most expensive without your knowledge. After putting in my credit card info, they then go to the billing page telling you what they charged to your card. "
"Carfax is a joke. Seems everyone has the same issue. I bought a truck in September 2017. I recently tried to trade it in and they offered 5k less because ""damage"" was reported December 2017. I owed the truck and I reported no damage. The truck is perfect. They only deal with people through email. I got their number from using the old school 411. I have contacted the BBB. Hopefully they can help us all out. When I called Carfax number a very, very rude woman answers. She must be embarrassed working for Carfax. I asked to speak to the president Richard Raines. He was available but she asked what's it concerning and she said he will not speak with me. I'm at a 5k loss with Carfax. I see over 600 negative reviews on this company. It would be nice if we can all get together and sue the crap out of them."
"I would like to trade in a car. I am the original owner. Carfax claims there have been two prior owners and that the car was impound and a junk title was created 4 years ago. So, according to the two dealers I have spoken with my car is now worth nothing instead of five to six thousand dollars. Carfax only deals with thing electronically therefore I haven't had any contact from them except for this: ""Help is on the way! Use this reference number for follow up: #..."" It would be nice to get an answer."
Truck got stolen and I got it back and had to have the side mirror replaced. Well nice old Carfax put structural damage on there also. Showed them the insurance report and body shop report that it only had side view mirror damage. Neither of those have structural damage on it. Sent them an email about it takes them a month to get back and they that is not what they need. Then I ask what is it they need to remove it and never hear from them again. Why in the world do car dealers even go off this crap company. Biggest joke ever.
"Bought a car from dealer on 3/2017, report generated 3/9/2017, clean title, no accident or damage. 1 year later I try to sell my car, discovered damage on the report, when was the damage? 9/2013... 4 years before the report was generated, funny part the day that they started reporting this kind of information on 7/2017. So, they had the information for 4 years but decided to release after the car was sold by the dealer. Here comes the scam, they hide the info to benefit the dealer, once car shows as sold, they release the information, not to hurt the dealer, I complained and they said information was not available at the time I bought my car, Again by what the reporting say!! ABC news had reported them on 2012 similar complaints. I will contact them also. Very similar behavior when you search customer complaints online."
"Nowhere in the purchase page does Carfax tell you their product expires EVEN IF YOU DON'T USE IT! You have to dig deep in their TOS to find that out. Avoid them, no need to pay for this crappy service. Instead, go with a competitor (without naming names) that offers non-expiring reports. This kind of rip-off pay scheme should be taken out of business."
"Purchased truck April 6, 2018, 3 hrs. later and 198 miles, had a wreck. Exit ramp domino stop effect and I was last in line and could not stop. My bumper was bent and grill was cracked a bit. Being a new truck I reported on insurance and had OEM only parts replaced. Not a bad wreck at all. Well, several months later, entertained the idea of trading for a smaller truck. Dealership came back with an offer of half what the truck would be worth and said it had a Carfax of ""severe accident"" against it. After researching into the issue, Carfax took the police report as factual. The officer put ""Major damage"" on the accident report. I've been back and forth with this now for several weeks. The police report is an opinion of the officer filling out the report and not facts, (it states this on the report). Carfax says if I get the officer to change his report they would change theirs for my truck. Of course that isn't going to happen... "
"In April 2014 we were in the left turn lane when Jeep in front decided to get out of that lane, put car in reverse and backed into our car which was much lower. It creased the hood, fender, knocked out headlights. The airbags did not deploy, we were not hurt, car was not towed, we finished our errand, drove the car home and drove it 15 miles to certified Mercedes dealer for repairs. I have documentation re: accident from repair shop listing no structural damage. So four years later we are trading this car in on a new car. The Carfax came up reporting structural damage."
"CARFAX Vehicle History Report for this 2006 Chrysler Pacifica Limited Platinum: ** indicates 2 owners, but it has only been registered to one couple. It also indicates that a rear-end accident (air-bags NOT deployed) and no damage was noted. This vehicle only registered to one couple since initial purchase; has NEVER BEEN INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT!!! And the vehicle remains in the hands of the original lessees/owners."
"Ran report on my car June 30th. There was a false claim that ""insurance company reported as total loss"". I had of $3400 bodywork from me hitting something in the garage. No frame damage. Provided a letter from the insurance company (USAA) with contact information to verify not a total loss and that they never reported anything to Carfax. Weeks later nothing happening and so I spent 3.5 hrs at DMV to get the record to show no loss. Get standard emails - 2 asking for same info, 3rd not acknowledging the attachments I sent. No way to talk to a human on the phone. This is keeping me from selling the car which I need to do for the money. Plus it's the best month to sell a jeep weather wise. This is nuts that one month later and nothing. Does anyone know of an attorney or consumer advocate that can help?"
"Carfax cost me $7,000 when I traded my 2008 Silverado (60,000) miles for a 2019 Mini Cooper S. If you idiots are gonna report an accident, do it accurately! All you told my dealership was I had been in an accident. I ran into a concrete POST - short one I didn't see. The right front fender took damage - NOTHING else!!! PIGS! Either DON'T report your accident or fix it yourself which I should have done - would've saved $7,000."
"I am trying to sell a very expensive car which are hard to sell. I had a prospective buyer, but he informed me that there were errors in the Carfax report and was concerned. I ran a Carfax report when I bought the vehicle and the report was clean. Now the report says that the car is under a dealer consignment and there are errors in the odometer. I have NEVER had the car to a dealer for anything than normal maintenance and have NEVER altered the odometer. I have tried to contact Carfax and they will not return my E-mails. As far as I am concerned Carfax is a scam and will never willingly have any dealings with them again and do not trust their reports."
"MY PROBLEM IS THE SAME AS MANY PEOPLE REPORTED SO BEWARE!! CARFAX ARE SCAM ARTISTS!! I can just cut and paste others complaints because my situation is almost IDENTICAL!! I only needed 1 report put on MY car which I want to sell. Same as others, I very clearly clicked the 1 report button for $39.99. Credit card authorization came through at $104.99. Contacted them through website (they curiously have no phone number for consumers) and I tried calling the phone # for Dealers (1-888-788-7715) and was told they can't handle it. It's only for dealers, use live-chat or email option (nobody answers either!!). "
"They appear to take advantage of electronic ""he says, she says"". I only needed 1 report on a car we had already decided to buy. Very clearly clicked the 1 report button for $39.99. Credit card authorization came through at $104.99. Contacted them through website (they curiously have no phone number for consumers) and was ignored. Amazingly the charge posted on my account the next day. Nothing ever goes from authorization to post that fast. Sent a second more heated complaint through website and got a ""we're on it reply"". Disputed the charge through credit card company. Three days out and nothing has happened. Beware! They can say you clicked button you did not click and rip you off for $65 (or more). Will update this post if this resolves. They have already wasted hundreds of dollars of my time."
Their search form requires a zip code and will only show cars near that zip code. I want to search nationwide but cannot do so. Why would you not allow a national search? Very poorly designed website and forms. Other companies are much better.
"I purchased an Expedition on 4-16-2018 and on 4-17-2018 an accident shows up on Carfax from 2-26-2018. Almost 2 months AFTER the wreck, and ONE DAY after purchase... Carfax would do NOTHING to resolve. Poor customer service."
I have tried to get the Carfax report corrected for my vehicle without any success. They claim according to their 'source' there was damage to my vehicle and it had to be towed. This never ever happened. This car has never been in any accident or damaged or towed. I tried to tell them this but they kept insisting that their source has reported this. I had Geico issue a letter stating there were no claims filed for that specific date. Carfax's response to that was that not all accidents are reported to the insurance company. I told them to tell me who reported this so that I can follow up with them and try to investigate this apparent incident and that as an owner of this vehicle I have the right to know who incorrectly reported this damage and tow on it. They did not even bother replying after that. After first two emails they stopped responding to my emails altogether. 
"I am very upset with Carfax, I bought a certified used car in 2016 and was shown a Carfax report saying the car has never been in any accidents, Well I tried to trade that car in last night and found out that 2 months before I bought the car there was frame damage. I was told even when I completely pay this car off I will get nothing for it. I was told in 2016 things were not being reported to Carfax. This accident happened 4/20/2016. I bought it in July and this wasn't reported until July of 2017. So now thanks to Carfax I am stuck with this car no matter what."
CARFAX reported that there was structural damage done to my vehicle from an accident. This is completely false information as there was zero damage to the frame or unibody of my vehicle yet they still incorrectly reported this as an issue with my vehicle. I did not know until last week when it was pointed out to me by someone interested in my car. I have been trying to sell this vehicle for over a month unaware that CARFAX had done this and consequently I have lowered the price of my vehicle by $3k because I was getting very little responses which I blame on CARFAX incorrectly listing damages to my vehicle. I will lose $3k from selling my vehicle which is how much below the value Edmunds and Kelley Blue Book suggests the car is worth based on the features and condition of my vehicle. 
"I purchased a vehicle from an auction. The auction uses Auto Check. Auto Check reported no fraudulent activity, so they did not announce anything about mileage discrepancy. The National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) also listed nothing fraudulent. CARFAX, however, listed mileage rollback fraud. The issue was that whoever did the inspection in January 2016 input the wrong mileage. Anyone with a brain can see that this was a simple human error and nothing fraudulent. Why would anyone roll the odometer forward from 85k miles to 178k miles back to 85k miles? CARFAX notes this as odometer fraud preventing me from selling my vehicle for the fair market price."
I have a car for sale in which was involved in a car vs deer accident. I had a buyer until they pulled the Carfax report that stated the airbag deployed. I contacted my insurance company to ask why this was reported. They pull the claim and told me they hadn't reported that and that they would send me proof that the airbag never deployed. I contact Carfax by email because that's the only way to communicate with them. I was informed that they got their information from a police report. I asked for a copy in which they stated they didn't have and needed me to get a copy and send to them before the correction could be made. They stated that the information from my insurance company wasn't good enough. 
"I purchased Carfax before I bought a vehicle a few years ago. I ran a number of vehicles through before I found one I was willing to take a chance on. What a mistake. I travelled a long distance for the vehicle and ended up purchasing it. Much to my chagrin, the title had been salvaged in Ohio. The truck purchased by a used car dealer in Michigan who posed as an independent party on Craigslist. The title was not a salvage title in Michigan. The frame was badly rusted. "
"Out of curiosity I ordered a Carfax report on my 2011 Ford Edge that had numerous service calls on the SYNC system. All that was on the report was routine service calls, no problem calls. I only took that car to one Ford Dealer for all service. How can I trust a Carfax report?"
"Carfax is a SCAM and they often report FALSE information that will prohibit a consumer from buying/selling a vehicle. I found out over the weekend that Carfax has flagged my current vehicle for potential odometer fraud insinuating that the odometer has been ""rolled back"". This is completely FALSE and inaccurate. The reality is that they FAIL to keep accurate records and then report inaccuracies as the truth. Furthermore Carfax is NOT an accredited organization."
"Carfax has incomplete records. Really the only thing it is good for is some service records and some title transfers that are incomplete. THEY also make assumptions that may not be right, another words just guessing. They should really not do that. It is overpriced for what you get. I think a better way to spend your money would be to hire someone to inspect your vehicle if you're not confident in doing it yourself."
"Ok this is a company, like Equifax, which I do not give permission to report on me especially when the report is wrong due to CarFax screw up and accuses me of odometer rollback due to their screw up - I file a complaint their response is to have me fill out the same form I had already filled out. They say in a chat room they will get back in 5 days (of course that is from the date of the 2nd form I filled out). Now it is going on the 7th work day and still no response and I seem to be blocked from the chat room. You are costing me thousands. SO NOW I WILL TRY TO BURY THEM WITH FAXS."
"Carfax is a scam company! They print out many, many mistakes and HONESTLY they do not verify the car problems. They just print them without asking if the report is true or not... Use Carfax at your own risk, it is NOT a true report and the scam company CARFAX refuses to correct the problem even if I prove them wrong!!! TOO bad too many people are brainwashed with that crap!"
"I purchased a 2016 Cadillac Escalade that was one year old on 4/17 with a Carfax report that showed no accidents. Now I go to trade in the auto for a new auto and there was an accident that showed up from 9/16. Carfax will not honor their so called buyback guarantee. When I contacted them they said I should not rely on their report and should have gotten an inspection before the purchase. The car came with a 172 point inspection from Cadillac and they didn't catch it. Carfax has to be one of the biggest SCAMS going. The government should shut them down for misleading the public, they make millions of dollars and really provide false security when using their reports at the time you are spending your hard earned money to purchase a car/truck."
"Purchased a ""Certified"" 2013 BMW 328xi in August 2015 with a clean Carfax report. Went car shopping over the weekend. A Carfax report was pulled from the dealership I originally brought the car from. But guess what an accident from the first owner magically appeared and wasn't recorded by Carfax until 2 years later. So now the value of my car has dropped, I owe more on the car than it's worth. The salesperson at the BMW dealership looked dumbfounded and kinda shrugged his shoulders. This smells like fraud to me. How is it that large businesses are allowed to get away with things like this. Very disappointed in Carfax which now I know is an unreliable source and BMW Gallery in Norwood, MA."
"Carfax allows dealers to falsify reports. Purchased a used car from Spreen Honda in Redlands CA with their provided Carfax report. Reported it to Carfax and they do NOTHING about it. Don't ever trust Carfax reports of Spreen Honda in Redlands, CA."
"I purchased a 2007 Ford F150 for fair market value from a dealer in my city. The CARFAX provided to me on the date of purchase noted NO TOTAL LOSS REPORT. Four (4) days after I purchase the vehicle, a TOTAL LOSS appeared on the document. But wait... there's more. The date of the TOTAL LOSS was noted to be 9/17/2008. Almost five years before the report was added to the CARFAX. On my original CARFAX report, there is an ACCIDENT NOTED on a specific date, lo and behold, on the most recent CARFAX DOCUMENT, there is a TOTAL LOSS reported on that EXACT SAME DATE. What this says to me is that CARFAX had the information and mistakenly omitted it from the document. Due their negligence, I purchased a total loss vehicle for regular vehicle price. Contacting CARFAX directly has been absolutely no help. No explanation, no apology, and no hint of honoring their buyback guarantee."
"While recently searching for a used Ford F-150 I utilized Carfax reporting to check on reported accidents. I paid a price for this service which I thought I could trust. While I did find 1 or 2 useful with reports of accidents, I avoided those vehicles. I opted to purchase a 2006 with a clean accident report from Carfax. It did show an auction purchase, but that wouldn't matter as many vehicles now go through auction and I can accept that."
"Several months after my classic Porsche (CA lic. **) had been stolen I bought the Carfax history for the car. It did not show up as stolen in the report, even though I had gone to great length to make sure that the car would be entered into every possible database of stolen cars. Now, 21 months after the theft, I got a message from Carfax saying it is time to renew the registration for that car."
"I had contacted Carfax and after weeks of no reply they pull up an old and invalid police report saying my airbags deployed. I wish they knew the economic damage they cause by their recklessness and laziness. I would never do business with them had not every dealership put their blind faith into a company with no regulation other than ""We won't change anything if you show us proof or not."""
"CarFax is the biggest joke around. They report that there is a ""damage report"" to my car with front end damage. They do not describe damage, they do not tell where in the United States this occurred, and they do not give any way to confirm or deny. When I sent them an email, (because they suck so bad you can only fax or email) they said the info was from a confidential source and could not disclose. What are they the FBI now. CarFax is a sham as most say and if anyone knows how I can sue them for reporting bogus info let me know."
"In 2011, I purchased a 2006 Chevy Avalanche from an AutoNation dealer on Sahara in LV, NV. I was shown a Carfax that had come from another dealer but with my truck vin # that showed no issues. 6 years later after many headaches and a lot of money put into my Avalanche to try to keep it running, I went back to the same dealership to trade my Avalanche back in. When they did the appraisal for the trade in for my truck, they told me it was worthless because NOW on the Carfax report, it shows my truck as a ""Total Loss""! Carfax reported a Total Loss on my truck 2 years after I made the purchase!!! I had a clean title in hand, DMV registration, and insurance, and all that time I'm driving a worthless truck considered a ""Total Loss""! How do I get my compensation? What's next? AutoNation has turned their back saying they did nothing wrong, Carfax is impossible to get a hold of! Yea… ""Total Loss"" for me!"
"I purchased a vehicle from a reputable local dealership after being shown a clean Carfax report by the floor representative. The first week of owning the vehicle I began to experience problems with my 2008 Lexus IS 250. Expenses: Price for Vehicle : $ 23,333.00. Dec 31, 2014 battery was bad after first week of purchase - Jan free warranty at Holler. Hood latch assembly would not properly close the hood. - Feb - NA had to rig the car to get it to close by removing under the hood bumper bolts so hood closed into the frame of the vehicle frame past where it was supposed to line up at. Headlight assembly - HID ballast went bad -Mar 800.00. ac Freon leak, oil leaking out of timing chain cover on engine block - Oct 2,000.00. 2015 AC compressor went out because of the AC leak - May 800.00. Water pump failed - July 650.00. Then loose ground would not start 95.00 diagnosis + towing 200.00."
"This is the second inaccurate Carfax report I've had to deal with. The first report took me weeks to correct. This had to do with a false odometer report from a dealership. After much effort, I was able to get it deleted and got a fair trade in on my car. The second report was an inaccurate one from the police department, which cannot be changed and the police person I spoke with maintained that their officers are not trained in assessing accurate damage reports. Still Carfax publishes these reports! However, after contacting Carfax, they are willing to include my repair bill next to the inaccurate police report. I've decided to keep this car, since I will never get a fair trade in! Twice I've tried to trade in cars, both times these reports published by Carfax have made my experience a nightmare!"
I fell for the Carfax salesman who gave me a special deal for 6 months (which by the way is outrageous cost). Then I send them notice of cancellation by phone and email. I think when a person does no longer want a service a simple call should work. But not with carfax they want to keep you on the hook and act like they never received notice. Frankly Autocheck is more accurate and Carfax is way too costly.
"I wish I could give them a zero star review, because that would be kind to them. I am an insurance agent, and have found how bad CARFAX can affect a car's value. One of my clients had a fender bender, and the only damage to his car was the grill was broken. It was replaced with a BRAND NEW Ford OE grill. The current CARFAX report now shows ""structural damage"" and the car's value has diminished significantly."
"I got a 2013 ML350 at this certified dealer and the Carfax showed no accident when they gave it to me. This Monday I went. I ran a Carfax and it’s showing an accident from 2013 by the first owner. I never knew my car was into an accident. I still owe 30,000 and at Prestige they only want to give me 23,000 for it instead of paying me all I have given them due to the fraud. This is not fair and I want my money back."
"This service is not what it is advertised to be. The report I received from Carfax did not show any damage to the vehicle we purchased - NONE. We later found out that it had flood damage. But because it was never reported, it did not show up on any reports. This service is only as good as the people reporting damage. As far as I am concerned the service is worthless and does not do the consumer any real service. A complete waste of your money."
"Someone backed into the car and not the piece off the bumper. I filed a claim with the insurance company, took it to the body shop. They told me the hood has been fixed and the bumper is put together with zip ties. They can't guarantee the work because the work is so shoddy they won't fix the car. I've only had the car six months. The dealer set up appointment with me for Tuesday and he was a no-show. Carfax was supposed to be clean. What are my options?"
"My car had it's bumper LIGHTLY TAPPED with NO DAMAGE in my child's school parking lot, NO DAMAGE. The principal called for a police report as it was their standard procedure no matter how minor the damage, even if no damage, the result was my car coming up on a CARFAX report when I went to trade my car in for a new one a year later. The dealership stated that even though my car had NO DAMAGE, just the fact that it has a CARFAX report they dropped the trade-in offer on my car by $3,500!! Just because it came up on CARFAX, with NO DAMAGE! CARFAX is destroying resell and trade values on people's cars even when there is no damage. CARFAX is a terrorist organization out to destroy as many car values and people's lives as possible."
"Was trading in my 2005 Chrysler Pacifica. I am the original owner, know everything about this car from day one. Everything was going well, the dealer offered me $4,000 trade in for it. We had the offer sheet in hand, we're making the deal happen. Then they pulled a Carfax report. Imagine my shock when they told me my car was a total loss! I have a clean, clear title, car has NEVER been a total loss! Unfortunately, the dealer couldn't even take my trade at all now. So, we wound up having to buy GAP insurance, finance the extra $4000, plus tax. This has cost me $6,000. Matthew at Carfax who finally reponded to my emailed correction request form basically told me ""no,"" they won't help me, other than to correct the report. Too late, I told him, I am out at least $6,000 because of your error. I expect Carfax to make me whole!"
"We spent two days looking for a new truck. Found the one we wanted and went in to make the purchase and trade in our current truck. Dealer came back saying that Carfax said it was only worth $1000 because it was reported as a total loss at one time. Problem is that it has never been in an accident! It has been burglarized but not to the extent that it was a total loss. 8 years ago when we were visiting our infant in the NICU, our truck was broken into. They broke a window and stole my husband's stereo. They tried to steal the truck but couldn't. As a result, they messed up the ignition and the truck wouldn't start. The insurance company fixed everything and it was never totaled, not even close! 7 years later we go to sell and because of Carfax's incompetence, the dealer wont give us what it is worth! Carfax is a bunch of **! Beware consumers! Their reports are inaccurate!"
"I purchased unlimited Carfax reports for 90 days. As I shop online for cars regularly, I thought this was a reputable company to work with. After my 5th purchase, I was unable to pull any additional reports. It seems as though the Unlimited is by car tag only. How many online ads do you see where the tag is clearly visible? In fact, dealerships remove the tags and most individuals cover the plate in their pictures. I believe this is deceptive and hope my poor experience with these guys will provide others a reasonable heads up to avoid the same mistake."
"On 3.1.17 I joined Carfax to use for buying a truck, used 1 time and have been unable to log in since. They did take my $69.99 for service provided, have called 5 times for help, no real person to talk to. Would not recommend this service."
I was informed that a potential buyer of my vehicle was informed that there was possible odometer rollback and did not buy the vehicle. I questioned Carfax and they said they made a mistake and they were wrong in their report!
"I as well purchased the ""unlimited package"" only to find out on the next click of the mouse, it was for 5 VIN checks and unlimited license tag checks. I tried to contact them and was unable to get anyone to help. I emailed them and never received a response. I would not have purchased the unlimited if I had known the whole story. This company seems to have a reputation built upon hype and not facts. I will not use them again."
"I purchased the BMW 2013 X5 and trusted the car history stating I still have 10-month manufacturer's warranty since the car registered in December, 2017. But I found out the warranty was expired in Feb, 2017 since the car was register in Feb, 2013. In addition, there is recall to the car but the car dealer provided me a no-recall report to be confirmed. So obviously, Carfax did not even verify the information with VIN for the date of the vehicle at all. It cannot be mistaken about the date of the registered date of the car. Where was the car before December 2013 though? I felt very disappointed and am thinking of how to claim for my right to have Carfax to fix their mistake."
"I went to trade my Lexus which I purchased as the second owner from original Lexus dealer I was offered $2k less on trade in due to accident from original owner. Interesting on bottom page 2/5 one line one word accident. On top page 3/5 one line one word damage. Then full line with a new record car re-registered 07/05/11, next line 07/02/12 re-registered, next line re-registered 07/07/13 then dealer inventory with next incident registered to new owner!"
"I've been a long time customer of Carfax. Recently it has become more and more difficult to correct problems on a Carfax. If an independent oil change company reports incorrect data, they can simply state whatever, and it is fact. I pay Carfax for their resources. Independent oil change companies do not. I've purchased units at auto auctions with a clean Carfax, only to get the car back to the dealership and an item has been added that jeopardizes the Carfax. It's becoming a big issue and time constraint! Just sharing my frustrations! Thanks!"
"I was hoping Carfax would make the car buying process safer and easier by helping me to make a more informed decision about which car to purchase. Instead, I was ripped-off. I paid to be supplied with misinformation. Bad intel. When I asked for a refund, I was told ""This account does not qualify for a refund as two or more reports have been ran."" This is CARFAX saying ""It took you three times to realize you were being fooled, so now we keep your money!"" The CARFAX representative that responded was sarcastic and misspelled words. "
"I was very disappointed when trying to sell my car. The dealer said that Carfax had a report that I had had an accident with the car, with damages. I never had an accident. The report caused me to get less for the value of my car, as they could only go by the Carfax report."
"I went to trade my car Friday and learned CARFAX has it listed as having structural damage... I contacted the insurance company and the company that repaired my car after the deer accidents and both have told me they ""never"" reported anything to CARFAX and that I had no such damage! I contacted CARFAX with all of the information (written) from the 2 places and they responded with ""I have submitted your data dispute and research has concluded that all information provided to CARFAX regarding the damage event is correct. So I am unable to remove the record off of the Report."" This is BULL!!! Thinking a call to an attorney may be next!"
"I bought a used 2011 Ford Edge from Ford of Kirkland in January 2016. I was told the price was 17k. After they ""discovered"" my car had never been in an accident, per Carfax, the price went up to 20k. Unfortunately I did not discover this until after I had signed the paperwork. When I called the salesperson upset he kept emphasizing I had a great, lower mileage, no accident car. Of course fluids leak, transmission has issues engaging, etc. Too bad for me. I just changed insurance companies this month. Guess what? A few months prior to my purchase, my car was in an accident incurring $2700 in damages. Thanks for the CARFAX. What a worthless piece a paper."
"Recently obtained a carfax which had completely false information. I contacted them to have the information removed and it was a nightmare. The customer service person Lynsey is a miserable person who likes to torment customers just to make herself feel powerful. She is spiteful, nasty and an outright ugly human being. Bottom line: If you are purchasing a used car the carfax report is useless because it's likely that significant damage was never reported. Additionally information on the report may be false, exaggerated or otherwise misleading. If you own a vehicle Carfax is just an absolute menace that will diminish the value of your property."
"This is the same as so many stories here: We purchased a used vehicle a little over 3 years ago from a dealer which included a clean 1-owner Carfax report. We recently started shopping around for something bigger to replace our ""one-owner, clean Carfax"" car. The first dealer we went to made a reasonable offer on our car, but we couldn't find anything we liked to trade it on. A few months later, we finally found something we liked, but when that dealer valued our trade, they offered us $1000 LESS than Dealer #1 did a few months back - and said that the Carfax report showed out ""Accident-Free"" car had indeed been in an accident. I still had the original Carfax from when we bought it in the glovebox, so we compared the two - and a month before we went to Dealer #2, Carfax had added an accident to the car's report... FIVE YEARS after it apparently originally happened... Which was YEARS before we bought it."
