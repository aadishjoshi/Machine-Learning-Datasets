"It appears to me that the issues people are stating do not fall under warranty, that is why warranty wasn't used. Warranty doesn't cover everything, especially wear and tear like tires for instance, or mold. Also, if you have issues with the smell from the beginning why wouldn't you ask for it to try to be fixed before you bought it. I have a CarMax Mini Cooper, 2011 and extended warranty and I'm responsible for things such as dim lights or tires, etc. I was going to buy a Volkswagen originally but I could tell a smoker had previously owned the car. They attempted to fix it and it was better but not up to my standard so I didn't buy the car. "
"Ok, so first of all - Reading some of these comments are TOO hilarious! Most of them are people who do not have their documents together, not understanding the website or just think they are getting a “new car”. These are ONLY USED CARS! Next, YOU ARE BUYING A CAR! You’re are not getting a combo at Burger King, clothes or some small item - it’s a car! It’s going to take some hours, depending on what you are getting done. Second, you have to get that mess out of your head that USED cars are NEVER going to have any issues. No matter what new age or small of miles, as the first owner or second owner you can NOT predict how they used and took care of that car. I love how Carmax reconditions their vehicles, upfront with the prices and they offer the Extended Warranty. I would only assume those people who don’t get the warranty has the most repair problems and paying thousands of dollars. "
"I have been shopping online for the past 6 months for a GMC Yukon XL at multiple websites and have visited dealerships for a test drive. I was a little reluctant when I saw a vehicle that was in my price range with the low mileage that I wanted for sale on Carmax's website because I question where they get their vehicles, reputation, return policy, etc. The vehicle was located two states away and it was a $99 shipping fee to the local dealer by my house, so I figured if I don't like it I will just eat the $99 fee. I must mention that previous to this purchase I did a lot of research, test drove multiple vehicles and made offers at local reputable dealerships, but received the run around treatment and classic used car dealer line of ""our vehicles are priced aggressively to sell"" with zero flexibility on their overpriced tags (overpriced both on Edmunds and KBB). To say that my patience was at an all time low would be an understatement."
"This is my second time purchasing through Carmax in Norcross, GA. I must say that both times were smooth sailing. The first time, my cash car had given out on me and I needed a car asap. My cousin recommended Carmax so I went online, applied, got my approval for the amount I was willing to spend, walked in the store the next day signed paperwork and walked out with my car. This second time, that same car was in a wreck and was written off. I knew it would be some time while the insurance company did their part but I applied for the amount I was willing to spend to not be in a rental for too long. "
"I will never buy a car anywhere else! Seriously. Whenever a friend or family member talks about buying a car, I always suggest Carmax because of how easy it is. In 2015, I walked in nervous about buying a car but walked out two hours later happy and driving my perfect car. First off, I never felt pressured. My first experience at a car dealership when I was a teenager left me in tears. All the Carmax people were friendly, respectful and genuinely seemed to care about my family's needs."
"I purchased a $13,000 Honda CR-V EX-L from Carmax. In hindsight, the car was probably $3000 overpriced. I purchased the vehicle 6 mos. ago, in November 2018, and have since had to sink $4000 into maintenance that should have been covered under their infamous ""120 point"" inspection. My latest debacle with this vehicle involved a full replacement of the air conditioner condenser at $1000+. What concern would Carmax have selling me an EX-L model without a functioning A/C in November, right. Other problems involved fully engine gasket replacement, fouled spark plugs, and I can go on and on and on.... Bottom line -- AVOID CARMAX LIKE THE BLACK PLAGUE. THEY EXIST FOR THE PURPOSE OF RIPPING YOU OFF!!"
I had problems with my air the day I purchased vehicle. They put me in a rental only to say they fixed it but no they didn’t. Then they sent to Kia. Still not working. Two years later and I still owe three years on this vehicle and I need a new engine due to no neglect on my end. Thanks for selling bad cars and no they don’t do any kind of point inspections. If they did I would not have this many issues.
"I don't know if the Carmax site qualifies since it actually has brick and mortar stores but, the ability to search model, year and price and have the car brought to me was important. Also, it was comforting to know that they have a certification process for each vehicle sold."
"Found Vehicle of interest in Maryland. Had it shipped to King Of Prussia in attempt to test drive & inspect it on 4/8/19 - Dealt with person named Josephine @ Carmax via internet. Received email that vehicle was on location in KOP & forwarded a buyer's contract to sign prior to inspection. ""Putting the Horse before the Cart!"" Replied with email on Friday 4/12/19 that needed to test drive & inspect vehicle prior to signing any contract. No response. Advised Josephine would be back on Monday, 4/15/19. Emailed 2 more times, setting up appointment to test drive & inspect vehicle on Wednesday, 4/17/19 at 10:00 am. Drove hour away with my wife to inspect & test drive the vehicle. "
"Please DO NOT take your car to Carmax for an appraisal!!!! I owned a 2007 Cadillac XLR that was in like-new condition and they offered me only 13,000 for it. I then took it to a dealership and they gave me 21,000 on the spot for my car. I was not shopping for another car.... Only wanted to sell the Cadillac."
"Had to replace the engine after owning for 6 months. When the engine was pulled from the car, it was discovered it was not the original engine.... It was one that came from a junkyard. The dealership has given me the ""runaround"". Informed me today they would not do anything for me. This is a fraud.... Car marketed with 35K miles with an engine from a junkyard with unknown mileage. None of this disclosed. Still waiting for Joe ** to call me back. Do the right thing Carmax!! I will not stop until you do. Joe my number is **."
"If Carmax associates were the best they would take care of a friend of mine’s son who bought a CRV in White Marsh with a vibration right off the lot that only required a 3 hour fix/computer update trust me I have had a CRV and that’s all it needs to fix the problem, so this has turned into Carmax still having the car after a month with him using a brand new car for a loaner car which I’m sure Carmax needs back. So management and employees are giving them a total run around with the entire thing when it should have been just a simple fix from the start. He hadn’t even made the first payment or even taken delivery of the car yet shame on CarMax to take his hard earned money. Co workers and other friends aren’t going to Carmax ever again! I’m spreading the word and letting everyone know this place has no customer service and to avoid at all cost!"
"My vehicle was towed to CarMax for service on Feb. 5, 2019. I have photos of what my vehicle looked like before service was performed by CarMax. AAA towing and myself have photos. When I go to pick up the vehicle the front driver side fender is severely damaged. CarMax stated it was like that when they received it but never notified me. After going back and forth with CarMax. AAA towing provided photos proving that it was not like that when AAA dropped it off. Also, I have photos showing that it was not as well. CarMax stated that CarMax towed vehicle into shop. CarMax is not fixing the damage they caused."
"I found the SUV I wanted to test drive - a 2018 Ford Edge Titanium with 30k miles, online. Requested the transfer and the salesman called to set up an appointment. When we arrived at Carmax the salesperson was not available and got the financing person to take us on the test drive. She couldn’t even locate the vehicle in the lot. We walked all over then she asked us to wait inside until she could locate it. We really liked the vehicle and decided to go through with the purchase using my pre-approved loan from JSCFCU. "
"Ok, it's this simple, they will take your 10,000 dollar car, give you 5k for it, lump the other 5k you owe onto their car they're selling you. Their 15k car is really worth 10, so you're overpaying by 5k plus. Now add back in the 5k you owed on your car. Now you're at 20 grand for a 10k car. It's that simple, wholesale for your car and 110 percent retail pricing on ALL of their cars. Ready for the kicker, they'll give you better financing than anyone because it's in house financing AND they'll charge you a daily interest rate, making about half your monthly payment interest only. Confused yet? Disgusted yet? You should be...I will never buy from them again and will steer others away from them any chance I get."
"My daughter bought a car from CarMax Las Vegas, NV. Called and told them the problem. Was told they would run diagnostic and repair for free. She makes an appointment and when she arrives they state they won’t diagnose or repair the car for free. Pretty sad they say one thing and do another. How do they expect return customers. I know I will never do business with them."
"Carmax's employees take forever and a day to get back to you. Since you have to request a transfer instead of just being able to pay for said transfer it usually means that the car you were looking at gets sold out from under you. For a company that centers around cutting out having to deal with a sales person, you have to deal an awful lot with lazy employees who try to sell you cars you're not interested in because the ones you want get bought out from under you. In short, pick your poison."
"From the beginning this was looking like a 5 star review. Everything from the greeting to the streamline approach to selling a car. We bought a 2017 Ford Fusion on March 7, 2019 and when we went out to the bay we found a nice big yellow ribbon on the car. Then we walk up to the car and it's filthy. I asked the salesman what's going on with this and he said they run it through the car wash and that's it. Water spots, smearing, couldn't see out the windows. They were so bad. This really surprised me since they really seem like they have the car sales process so streamlined. All they need is some chemicals and a detailer and this could have been a five star. Very upsetting. My recommendation, don't sign until you look at the car after it has been ""cleaned""."
"If you need Carmax to send you a payoff quote, or send information to your insurance company, good luck! For tasks other than taking your money, they seem to 'lose' your request in their system. Very poor customer service. They have no ability to speed up a request once it is a second request. They do not seem to understand that owners have the right to hold insurance with whomever they please- and it does not have to be integrated in their 'Carmax' system."
"Beware of CarMax's finance policy, time it carefully if you are going to refinance. The cars are priced 5% above the 110% of the allowable finance rate and to refinance you will have to put down approximately $1300 on a $22K vehicle. In addition, they lower your score by approximately 10% if they are financing which can push your rate up. Consumer beware."
"My wife needed a reliable car to drive our young kids in, so she went with her father-in-law to the Kenosha, WI CarMax and ended up purchasing a 2012 Town & Country - 32,000 miles. Three months later, the van has all the dash lights on and intermittently stalls within 15 mins of starting the vehicle. Call CarMax and get the sob story that ""if you purchased extended warranty..."" Given that they sold my wife on all the care they take in their extended, quality inspection, why would someone expect to have issues with a ""thoroughly inspected car"" with 32,000 miles on it?"
"Have been dealing with Carmax for many years. However recently have been VERY disappointed. They seem that over the years they are REALLY trying to squeeze every penny out of potential customers. They cannot use the same process to appraise ALL vehicles which they currently do. I brought a high end car (MSRP over $100000). I understand very well the entire process and expect wholesale figures. HOWEVER, when their price comes in more than $7000 under what a dealer will give me tells me something is wrong with Carmax system. They definitely need to get back to the drawing board. Horrible experience from the home office. Will think twice about ever doing business with Carmax again."
We bought a Kia Sportage 2012 from Carmax. Less than a year the engine broke down. After 9 months exactly the engine broke down. They didn't help at all and the car cost us 6000 $. They are not helpful. They sell bad cars. Don't buy cars from them. And we called all the managers. No one helped us or did a small thing or even care. They sell bad cars and that's it.
"Purchased a 2013 Chevy Equinox. A week later engine light was on. Called and was told they could service in 3 weeks. Light went out. Car went 4 months, engine light came back on. Helped a friend out with flower shop on Valentines week. She gave me sign to put on car for delivery parking. That Sunday car wouldn't start. Triple A towed me to shop. Monday they said engine was bad. Had towed to dealer as instructed. Didn't hear a thing for a week. After constant calling, they came second week and inspected. They refused to honor their warranty I had PAID for. leaving me with useless car. Everyone there at CarMax said sorry. Said because I had the sign they considered it a commercial vehicle. Had to pay $3,000.00 for engine out of pocket. Car had BAD engine when I purchased it, they didn't care. Never again. HAD BEEN WARNED ABOUT CARMAX. NEVER EVER AGAIN. HIGHLY UNRECOMMENDED!"
"Although my 2008 BMW 335i has been in the shop more times than I can count. I am happy I chose the MaxCare plan. On second thought I wish I would of chose the longest extended warranty. I just paid 450$ for a oil leak that was ""fixed"" before? How does that work? And the only reason is because they replaced my front shocks."
"I went to Carmax on Frontage Road in Kansas. When I was in the car my check engine light was on. I asked the salesman about it. He talked to the service department. This car only had 16,000 miles. Well 7 days later you guessed it. Came back on again. Well I called the salesman. He said he would call me back. No return phone. I bought another car from them previously. I had a positive experience with that car. Even though it broke a month after my last payment."
"I have been a huge fan of CarMax for 10 years. I have bought my cars there and directed my family and coworkers to purchase from there as well. Within the last two weeks I visited CarMax looking for a new car. My local lot had several vehicles on site that would work but had all been reserved or spoken for. The salesman suggested I look online and find something at another lot and pay to have it transferred. I went online, found a possibility, then called my local store to set up the transfer which would cost me $150.00. But before I completed the transfer transaction, I ask them to call the transferring lot and ask if the car was very clean on the inside and the outside was free of major blemishes. My local lot called me back and said the car was impeccable and accepted my money for the transfer."
"The Carmax in Escondido, Calif resolved all issues with my car. Thank you."
"It was the day after the snow storm in Chicago, 2/12/19. As my car is warming up the doors lock while I'm cleaning off the ice on my car. My phone and keys are inside and I live alone, no one to let me into my apartment. Had to ask several neighbors before one let me use their phone. I don't have a phone number for MaxCare, so I do a Google search and get their main number for corporate/customer relations (800-519-1511). It is 650 am and their customer relations line is close. I end up going to through the finance department in the hopes that I could just be transferred to roadside so they can unlock my car."
"I purchased a certified used car from CarMax. At the moment the car is flooded from the rear, back seats, floor and trunk. I found out through my car ins. The car was in an accident from the rear previous to me purchasing it. Now I am stuck with a very wet car. Of course Carmax can do nothing about the situation. :("
Purchased a 2014 Lexus RX350 in late 2016. Began to have issues a few months later with door interlocks (had 2 replaced). When a third began to act intermittent we took the car back again and in a post repair test drive the Carmax mechanic said he heard some noise under front end while driving. Turns out they found all kinds of issues with front drivetrain. Torn boots was what puzzled me and then he went on to say it was worn so bad they was metal to metal contact. This was at 46K miles. Mechanic joked with my wife and told her it was due to rough roads. We were the second owner so I cannot speak for the first but during our ownership the car has never even been on a dirt road. 
Carmax is a terrible place to purchase a vehicle. I made the mistake of purchasing a G37x 2013 from Carmax. I paid for my car a year before my loan was up. Then I was told my title was sent in the mail (which I never received). When I told Carmax Finance they didn't want to help in the slightest. They told me I would have to pay an extra 200.00 for my lost title (that they lost). They also told me it's between the Post office and Myself and not their problem that it's lost. Never (Never) Buy a car from Elliot or anyone else at Carmax Naperville.
Carmax sold me two ** vehicles with electrical problems. One of the vehicle engines seized up - I will never ever buy another vehicle from Carmax. Please do not buy vehicles from Carmax - the vehicles they sell have or had major problems.
"I will NEVER do business with CarMax again and I suggest you think twice before you do. The return period policy is much too short. In my case I co-signed for a loan with CarMax to help my son get a car. The return period policy did not allow enough time for his insurance company to get back with him with the new premium amount. Once it did and we discovered that it would be prohibitively expensive, we were forced to return the car. He had the car for 30 days (we had first brought it back after a much shorter time) and we are being charged over $2,000 for his having had the car for one month. "
"I paid to have a Mercedes GLA 45 AMG shipped from Alexandria. It got here and I drove it. I planned to buy it. It was not washed well when it was on the lot and had some areas on the paint that I was concerned about. I told the salesman to wash it and I would look at it before buying. It was halfway washed at best. It still had areas I was concerned about. Long story short, it was washed 3 times and never was clean. I could tell someone had done a horrible job trying to touch up rock chips on the hood. I could have done a better job. I asked to see the manager and he told me it was a used car, but I was getting a great deal on a 120,000 dollar AMG car. The guy has no clue, these cars were in the 60 to 70,000 range when new. So, I walked out. "
"I have been dealing with Carmax for a while 2 years to be exact. I feel they really drag this out in hopes that I couldn't do anything to get rid of this car. I trusted them because they know better than I, I am no mechanic right? This nightmare all started with a rattle that took them numerous attempts to fix. Took my tow hitch off and put it back on etc... just to find out it was my shocks. Took it in for a noise. Something started smoking under the hood. Told them the transmission wasn't shifting right. They told me that's how they run, a year after told me they would appraise my car at 1000 dollars because the tranny is going out and the car is rusting. There is no way in 2 years a car rusts that bad that the value decreases that much. I owe 14 on the pos and it's worth like 3. They have attempted to fix a hissing in my dash for a year now. "
"I bought a F-150 truck from that in June of 2015. The second day I had it the alternator and battery died (that should have been a sign to return the truck, but unfortunately I loved the truck by them). I've had nothing but PROBLEMS with this truck. I've had to replace the battery and alternator twice, replace TRANSMISSION ($3,000), AC broke, replace catalytic converter ($700), spark plugs and wires replaced (500+), just to name a few things. And now they say it needs a new engine! I paid for an extended warranty when I bought the truck b/c it was a little older and I wanted to make sure I had coverage if something broke down. "
I am looking for a 2007-08 Toyota Solara Convertible. Carmax had one in Las Vegas so I pushed the button to get it sent to Santa Fe NM for $250 so I could look at it. No response so I called and asked about the car. They told me that they didn't know if I or someone else had a hold on it. I was never called back and the car went back up for sale so I asked for a transfer and never heard back. Then someone from the first transfer emailed and said that the car was up for sale and was I still interested. I give up. I guess that they don't want to transfer the car or I don't know. Carmax sounds like a good idea if you can get the car and are willing to pay top dollar.
"I purchased a 2012 Nissan Leaf from the Carmax Costa Mesa store, in May 2016. We specifically asked, if the extended warranty covered the battery. Especially because we knew how expensive it is to replace. We wanted to make sure, it would be covered if the manufacture warranty expired. We were told yes, so we purchased the extended warranty. Now I find out today, the extended warranty doesn't cover any batteries. This is the engine of the car. How can you not cover this? We would not have wasted our money paying for the extended warranty and probably would have bought a different car. "
"I just spoke with a Representative not too long ago today. I was appalled at how rude I was spoken to. Carmax has used cars for high prices, and yet still will speak to you like you are not a valued customer. I cannot wait until I have paid off this car so I can take my business elsewhere. Every time I speak to a Representative they are never warm or welcoming."
"This insurance is very deficient and very bad attention, I had a sound on my wheel that has more than 1 year and Carmax still had not covered and had not repaired, I recommend not to buy cars on Carmax and either to take the warranty."
"I test drove two cars and then requested a transfer from Newark Delaware. I had no idea this would take a week. My calls and email messages were not returned. On the seventh day I went to look at the car and my salesman was busy but assigned another associate. The $30,000.00 car had a deep, wide scratch and a deep ding on the rear driver's side door. Carmax repaired the scratch with a brushed on paint. I commented that the deep scratch & ding needed to be filled sanded and spray painted properly. The manager came out and said the brushed on paint repair was acceptable for Carmax standards. The maintenance required light and a yellow warning light were on. No one knew how to turn it off. I went straight to the nearest Lexus dealer and bought a certified pre-owned car."
"I knew that car dealers and their lender companies were complete and utter crooks, but with how screwed over I have been getting screwed over by both of them, it's ridiculous. If they give you the lending company American Credit Acceptance, RUN OUT THE DOOR ASAP! They love to lie and steal your money."
"We did not buy a pickup from CarMax but... Bill from Murrieta, CA showed us around their facility and test drove two used trucks with us. He was very informative and patient. We were very specific with what we wanted and they did not have what we were looking for. Bill was awesome in trying to find our truck for us and even though we eventually bought our new truck from another dealer our experience at CarMax was great and I will be referring friends and family to try CarMax first. Thank you Bill!"
I bought a 2010 Volkswagen Jetta from Carmax on December 12th 2017 with 50 thousand miles on it. After the week return was up that’s when the transmission issues hit. After taking it to them 5 times with them pretty much calling me crazy I gave up. I have now owned the car for a year and it sits in my driveway because on top of all the transmission issues the timing jumped causing all pistons to hit the valves. There are metal shavings throughout the whole motor block. I still make payments on a car that is essentially totaled needing a 9000 dollar engine and transmission swap.
"I went to Carmax located in Stockbridge, Ga to purchase a reliable car and was sold a lemon Chevy Malibu that I couldn't drive for 8,500 miles and now my engine is no good at a $2100 cost. Thanks to Carmax."
"BUYERS BEWARE! CARMAX-6300 NW 167th St Hialeah, Fl 33104. Two Bad Experiences. I went in MAY 2017 to purchase a Car which was a Chrysler 200. I drove a car for less than a month and the vehicle started making some sort of jerking motion and the dash lit up with the check engine light on. I took the car back to Carmax service department on several occasions which patched the car in hopes that I would drive the car past the warranted miles or they simply did not care to fix the problem. "
"My teenage son bought his first car through Carmax. They talked us into buying the extra warranty and gap. All was good until he totaled the car in August 2018, we have been fighting with the Safe-Guard gap insurance for months now. They only owed $199 for the car to be paid off. As of now December 11, 2018, it’s still not settled and his credit is a mess, he can purchase another new or used car because of this. They have gave us the runaround and finally we just said forget the gap and we paid out of pocket. Don’t waste your money with this company. Hard lesson learned."
"DO NOT BUY MAXCARE!! Purchased a vehicle in 2016 with 14k miles on it. Was pushed to purchase the policy for my vehicle even tho my car was under manufacture warranty. Car sales guy told me it would not take effect until after the manufacture warranty expired giving me an additional 60 months and 15k miles of coverage. THIS IS A LIE! He also told me I would be able to get a refund for the policy if I didn’t use it. I sold the vehicle in 2018 and have been working with HORRIBLE customer service giving me the runaround for 3 weeks. Still NO REFUND!! Yet, The car salesmen make a bonus as you get the policy. When you call customer services the person you speak to will only be there for one week. I’ve spoken to 4-5 different people all telling me something different. Do not purchase MAXCARE policy!! Waste of money and HORRIBLE customer service. BAD BUSINESS POLICY. DONT FALL FOR IT!!!"
"I've done all my maintenance my vehicle. ""The motor is shot"". I have a puddle in the cab, this is a known issue on later vehicles and has a recall (not on my 2012). Called service and they could care less, they offered nothing. I purchased my vehicle in 2015 from Stockbridge, Ga and I still have a loan on it."
"Sold my car to them of which I purchased from them back in March of 2017 and was told nothing needed to be done on my end in regards to the Secretary of State and that they handle everything. Turns out they do absolutely nothing. Just received parking tickets in the mail for the car I sold to them. The is still in my name and whoever the sold the car to or auctioned it to never transferred anything or put plates on the vehicle. Now I am getting the complete runaround from the Tinley Park store along with their corporate headquarters in Virginia. Every person I speak to gives me a different answer. They claim they are handling it, however every time I contact the city of which the tickets are from they have not done anything at all. To matters worse since I do not have the original title since I signed it over to them there is nothing the Secretary of State can do for me. I would strongly advise to not do business with them and save yourself the headache."
I opted to purchase a car from them and have a FICO score of 788. Carmax chose to keep me as financier at a terrible interest rate of 12.3%. I asked if they shopped me around and they said once Carmax accepts you there is no other choice. I think that this is a HORRIBLE business practice and am now wondering if they do this to all customers or specific ones. My credit union is offering a 3.75 interest rate. In closing get your own financing as CM is ridiculous.
"If you're planning on trading a car at Carmax, do yourself a favor, DON'T. They will lowball you just like their name, to the ""MAX"". They'll point out non-existing issues, take the car and sell it for way more than twice they paid you. Sell or trade it somewhere else, you will get a LOT more $$$ for it. Now, it's true, it is up to you if you'll accept their offer but their lowballing and appraisers are two things that did it for me and to stay away from them."
"I bought a used Chevy Sonic 2014 from CarMax (8400 Anderson Boulevard Fort Worth, TX 76120). I paid $10,000 cash. Another $2,000 during the 7 mos I owned it. The first thing that happened was CarMax said they would inspect the car and have it ready. But when I drive it less than 100 miles all the lights went on. I took it to a car place and they said there were no fluids in the car. They said I should get my money back. I asked them to take the car back and CarMax said no! I don’t drive a lot. Maybe 10 miles a week unless I sometimes work which is 12 miles away. "
"Car Purchase went fine, Now Car has some problem with Brakes. Service depart don't have Appointment available for next 4-5 WEEKS. They don't understand the Urgency. How safe it is to drive car with having problem with Brakes?"
"On March of 2018 I purchased the 6th car from Carmax for my family in less than 5 years! Up to this point I thought the information given on previous accidents was accurate. However, I found this is not the case. The agent gave me a report stating there had been no accidents on the car. But when I went to re-sale the car 5 months later I was told the value of the car was being impacted by an accident in September of 2017. When I contacted the Carmax dealership (Raleigh NC) that sold me the car the Assistant Manager blew it off as no big deal. Apparently this happens all the time!! Please be aware they will NOT stand behind their cars when an issue arises. I’m exploring legal options at this point."
"The day I drove the off the lot in Dec 2017 and saw the front glass window was cracked I reported it to Carmax and after several heated discussions they replace the windshield. This purchase was made in Dec 2017. Two weeks later all the warning lights go on. I take it to a oil change shop and they tell me there are no fluids in the car. No oil. No fluids/no fluids at all. I called the Sales manager again and said I want to return the car because it was not properly inspected. I said, ""How do I know that the engine block did not crack."" I said, ""You sold me a car without properly inspecting it."" The dealer said no. He said it was past the 7 days of return. I paid $10,000 cash for the car. I only drive 10 miles or more a week. I am retired. I financed $4,000 and paid $2,000 off during that yr. In July 2018, in one week I had to replace the temperature gauge for $400."
"I purchase a vehicle from Carmax Oct 2017. Two weeks ago I went to a different dealer to trade that vehicle in. They ran a Carfax showing that 2 months prior to me buying the vehicle it was reported damaged on the roof and both front fenders. I went to CarMax and they told me that they use Autocheck which is supposed to be more accurate. That is if they report to Autocheck, after emailing back and forth come to find out from their own caseworker that the vehicle had hail damage. So they fix the vehicle, never reported it to Autocheck since they didn't fix it through an insurance company and sold it as if it was never damaged. That is Fraud. So now I'm in the process of looking for a lawyer to take them to court. Don't but a vehicle from CarMax without a Carfax report, don't just take their Autocheck report, they repair vehicles and don't report it to the Autocheck since they don't use an insurance company to repair them."
"Found a truck on CarMax.com in Merrillville, IN. and had it transferred to Madison, WI. Before the transfer, a walk around was done and we were told it had no scratches, dings, etc. Drove 90 miles to look at it and major scratch on the side of the truck and 3 other dings/scratches. The manager, Jeremy, was surprised they missed the scratch and since it had the potential to rust, they would send it next door to Abra body shop and have it fixed. Following weekend, made the 90 mile trip again planning to buy the truck. Scratch only slightly fixed. Jeremy said they felt that they could fix it themselves to CarMax standards. CarMax prides themselves with extra clean vehicles that meet high standards. Interior had not been wiped down and dog hair present and scratch fix unacceptable. We were lied to twice - once with the walk around and then with the body shop fix. Wasted gas, time and money. Stay away!"
"The salesman in CARMAX, Merriam store had presented to me a car accident report with 0 accident i.e clean car, so as a trustful organisation, I proceeded with the purchase. Then 2 years later, I intended to change my car to get another & in the process to trade in my car with the other one, the dealership had shocked me out when he brought the real CARMAX of my car showing that it had an accident one year before I bought it, accordingly my car price dropped like a half of its value due to the above matter. My advise don't trust them & check your car history individually."
"I haven't been one to write reviewers, but reading others' reviews about car dealerships just saved me (I believe) a ton of headaches in buying our newest car. CarMax was absolutely, totally wonderful."
"In early June 2018 the car was totaled. Nationwide Insurance Agency finally got a check to CarMax to pay off the vehicle in August 2018. CarMax began calling me in September 2018 stating that I was behind on my payments. I explained the situation and they stated that the check had been returned, not paid. I contacted Emily ** at Nationwide and she provided CarMax with the cleared check. CarMax contacted me again in October, stating the same thing. I said the cleared check had been sent. They said it had not, though Nationwide showed me where it had. So I contacted Nationwide again, I also asked CarMax, while this is under investigation to not report this to the credit agencies as they over and over again said it looked like an issue on their end. "
"I am not someone who enjoys the car buying experience. Most places make it way too inconvenient to the buyer and way too time consuming. I have had my share of bad experiences at dealerships. However, CarMax Austin, TX South took it to a whole new level. I was shopping for a stylish but economic vehicle to replace my aging Range Rover that consumed too much of my income filling it with gas."
"CarMax does not sell used cars; they are in the business of selling you an extended warranty with a used car. I used to rave about CarMax. We have purchased cars there before and never had problems. Too good to be true though... This past May 2018, my son purchased a 2015 BMW, Series 3. The first month it had a ""maintenance"" problem that CarMax covered with the 30-day warranty. However, less than 3 mths later, the car's whole dashboard goes out. CarMax agrees to pay for the diagnostic service. We take it to the BMW dealership that CarMax sent us to and later find out that things are much worse. There are 3 oil leaks that have to be repaired as well as the dashboard, totaling $6,000 in repairs. It was stated by the diagnostician (the one CarMax paid for and sent us to) that service for the oil leaks should have been done, but was not. The leaks were happening long before the car was sold to us."
"Now I know why CarMax showroom is so luxurious, they are ripping people off. I purchased a 2013 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited in January for $25,000, had problem after problem with the car, traded it back in 6 months later and they only gave me $19,000! Is that fair, no it’s not! Shame on you CarMax!!!"
"I bought a 2010 Jeep Grand Cherokee about three years ago. Since it was a used vehicle with unknown history, I decided to purchase the extended warranty thru 100,000 miles. The car was good and I had little to no problems for a while. The first issue I had with the service department came when I needed something checked quickly, but they would not even look at it for a week. In other words, their business model does not include any ability to assist a customer in an emergency. However, because I had paid for the warranty, I was locked in to using their service department. I recently had a problem with a noise from something loose and called for an appointment. After waiting a week for them to check it, they said a strut part, not the entire strut had to be replaced. No problem, I thought, until they told me that it would be from Tuesday to Friday for the work to be done. So I had to get a rental. "
"We purchased a used Prius from Carmax Riverside. There were a couple dings on the car that made us hesitant to pay the asking price. We included fixing the minor dings on the body in the purchase agreement, and were guaranteed that the repairs were minor and that their auto body department could easily fix the dings to make the car look perfect. Their first repair significantly increased the size of the ding and Carmax did not use the correct Toyota paint color! It looked much, much worse. The second repair again used the incorrect paint. The third time Carmax used the correct Toyota paint, but again, the repair looked much worse than the initial ding."
"I wouldn't even give it 1 star but didn't have a choice. CARMAX HAVE MY CAR FOR 9++ WEEKS AND 3 CAR PAYMENTS WITH YET AN ETA. LOT OF LIP SERVICE! Unfortunately I did not read reviews when I was in a desperate need of a new car. Purchased a 2014 vehicle w/ 30000 miles in Jan 2017. Fortunately I also purchased the extended warranty. My car has been back 4 times re: transmission. The first couldn't find anything, 2nd time they ""said"" it was a recall on a sensor. Tranny was no different. Called again. The service rep told me to take it to a trannny place and pretty much leave them alone. I purchased the extended warranty. NO YOU FIX IT. Brought it back again...and this time they did FIND that it needs a new tranny at 44000 miles! Wow!"
"I purchased a car from Carmax back in July 2018. Because of the ""No Haggle"" pricing structure the price was the price. I trusted Carmax to offer a fair price on the vehicles they sell. After only 2 months the vehicle was in a bad accident resulting in a total loss. Carmax sold me this vehicle for $2000.00 over the Clean Retail Value of the vehicle according to my insurance company. I contacted the General Manager at Carmax and he was unable to offer me any resolution to this matter. GAP coverage was not even offered by the Sales Consultant. Don't buy at Carmax - the ""no haggle"" pricing is not for the customers' benefit - it only benefits Carmax."
"2008 Kia Sorento disabled due to minor fire under dash. Carmax made up more issues with vehicle and I was forced to take their horrible offer due to towing issues, steer the engine transmission and many other parts of vehicle are worth more. Steer clear of Carmax..."
"Bought a truck 4 months ago, they kept my license registration fee and didn’t register with the state of Calif. Even after payoff. Called over 10 times, filed complaint with the state. Kearny Mesa Carmax is the worst customer service ever."
I took my son to Carmax in Lancaster to purchase his first new car. When we arrived the lady at the counter took our name and said someone would be with us shortly. Unfortunately an hour later we still didn’t receive help even though there were a few sales associates sitting at the desk doing nothing. Decided to go down the street to a competitor and received excellent customer service. If you want horrible customer service then Carmax is the place for you.
"Do not trust or use the ""hold"" feature if you see a car that you wish to purchase. The website states that you can hold a car for up to seven days. Somehow, after placing one and calling to check on the vehicle the day that we were to purchase, another person was in the sales office purchasing the vehicle that was promised to be held for me. I asked them to stop the sale because it was guaranteed on the site, but they would not. Somehow, my hold had disappeared. I am beyond upset with this company."
"I was approved for the California Replace Your Ride clean air voucher for $4,000 for a used car. The program limits you on what dealerships you can use and Carmax is their favorite. I was ready to purchase a car but then decided to price check it against other dealerships online and such. Only to find out that Carmax has a 30% markup. Suffice to say I was very disappointed when I realized that my $4,000 voucher wasn't going to save me any money because Carmax was going to rip me off. I literally saw the same car with the same mileage for $3,000 less at another dealership and $4,000 less from a private party."
"This was the worst experience of buying a car I have ever had. Spent 3 days trying to get an appointment. Salesman was nice. Put the info he printed from his computer, and what I was told were all lies. None of the parts of the car written on their paperwork, related to the things in the car were actually there. When I asked to see the controls etc. the salesman said he was not familiar and would check. They didn't exist and I would have been sold this car thinking they were there when they were not. Their solution. Different car different price, we're sorry. Do not go there and believe what they give you, not real."
"Two trips to two difference CARMAXs. The first car bought had mechanical defects. Red lights on, on the dashboard. Second, low balled me again on trade. Salesman just sat there, looking at me and said ""There is nothing I can do."" I walked away and one hour later, he called me and said ""Oh, we have decided to offer you an additional $2000 on the trade."" I said ""NO."" I will not deal with a bunch of crooks."
"Dishonest, slow, in my opinion lacking in integrity. If you even visit Carmax, which I don’t Recommend, do so to see a variety of car brands. Find something you like then go to that auto manufacturer dealership. You will be able to buy the same vehicle, brand new, for not much more than the used Carmax version (really inflated prices) then the dealership financing is better and will save you thousands. Do the math and most often in the end you have a new car with less long term cost."
"Talked directly with Larry of Carmax in Fairfield, made arrangements to come down and look at a 2018 Tahoe. I was specific about asking the condition of the paint to the extent to ask Larry (a) did he know how to tell if a panel had been repainted, (b) he said yes, (c) asked him to go inspect the Tahoe, (d) came back and said only 1 panel has been repainted. "
Went to Carmax on 8/22/18 to appraise my 2015 Cadillac Escalade. Car has 68k miles and KBB and Edmunds set a value of between $40 and $43k. Carmax valued the car at $35k stating rear left frame had damage. Their inspection took 5 minutes. Never had a accident with the car and didn't believe appraisal. Took the car to a Cadillac dealer on 8/23/18 and requested a detailed inspection of the car saying I was ready to sell it and wanted to know if there were any issues before putting up for sale. Paid the dealership for their inspection which took almost 40 minutes. Cadillac inspection determined I needed new wiper blades and should change the battery soon. No underside damage to anything including the frame. Beware of Carmax evaluations.
"Today is 8/8/2018 and I never had my heart broken since I lost my son. A week ago I registered with Carmax and reviewed many cars. I picked 4 cars and they ran my credit 5 times as I approved. Yes, I was approved all 5 times by a leading bank. I visited the dealership to pick up the 2014 Audi A6. They put the yellow bright bow on it after they washed it, then all staff told me congratulations!!! We finished all contracts and legal paperwork. They gave me 2 sets of keys, shook my head and me and my son walked out the door with the dealer to leave in my new car. The manager then peeped outside the door and told the dealer ""I need to speak with you"". "
"Be very careful, watch out! I had been looking for a very specific car and found it on the Carmax website. It was outside of my free shipping area so after many calls not only to the local Carmax dealer but the dealer in the other area I told them to send it. When it arrived at my local Carmax dealer it had been damaged. They said it was not their fault and said I must take the car. I asked that the car be repaired and they would not. At that point I said no to taking the car and wanted my shipping charges returned to me. Thank goodness I kept records and notes of phone calls, before and after pictures. Be very careful!"
"We took our second car (no longer needed) to CarMax in Madison, Wisconsin to sell. 1994 Honda Accord EX, manual, with 153000 miles in good running condition. One owner, clean, new tires, new exhaust system, recent brake work. Had scrapes and rust on right side from getting too close to a cement post. Clock and radio did not work and auto door locks made strange noises. They offered $100. Can you believe $100? We laughed out loud. We posted the car on Craigslist for $800 and sold it a few hours - had to turn away a dozen inquiries. We should have asked more. CarMax's appraisal was a joke! Don't waste your time."
"My experience is too long and horrendous to explain! The short story! I was approved for a truck to pick up in Boise Idaho. Halfway to Boise, I got a call telling me that my original application had a mistake on it (their part), so they needed to resubmit an application! I was already 130 miles away from home mind you! They resubmitted and the finance company wanted twice the amount down than originally submitted! So a few day later, we settled on another one! It needed to be transferred from Seattle to Spokane which was fine. I had no problem waiting for it! A couple of days later, I received a call from one of the managers telling me, that Carmax reserves the right to refuse service to anyone, and apparently, they refused to work with me! WOW! I was blown away! I hung up on the dude, 'cause I really didn't want to hear banter on about their policies! WOW! What the hell kind of company is this? "
"Do not buy a car here... I bought a 2012 Honda Civic Hybrid. I have had for a year and a half and the electric system has went out in the hybrid battery. When I brought the car I got a warranty on the car that was 60 months or a hundred thousand miles. I myself have not put that mileage on the car but they said because I had over a hundred thousand miles my warranty is no good. So now I'm stuck with a car that me and my family could here hurt driving because we could get electrocuted, lose my brakes and etc... Find another place to buy a car. Thank You."
"Be aware, you may think that the salesperson has ordered a transfer of a vehicle you wish to purchase and have been qualified to do so. However you find out days later that a sales manager can cancel that sale and transfer if they so chose. Even if Carmax company policy says they cannot. Then you get to spend days trying to get a response as to why. Good Luck."
"STAY AWAY!! Unless you're desperate!! My husband & I paid to have a vehicle transferred from Carmax in Midlothian, VA to Carmax in Newark, DE ($149). We drive an hour on a Sat. to get the vehicle. After getting an approval we had to provide paystubs, proof of address, etc. I had everything with me. The sales lady took my docs & handed them off to another woman that came up to me & asked me if I was able to contact my boss, who's an attorney & only has myself & 3 other employees that he pays. We do not get direct deposit, our checks are prepared with taxes taken out & shown on the paystub & the check is attached below. I rip off the perforated check & cash it. "
"Last week I recommended CarMax to my son who was looking for a 2017-2018 Camaro ZL1. I thought they were a good company, so, he found a car, did the financing online and was approved and got five offers. He was pre approved not pre-qualified. So he selected one of the offers and we went into the Merrillville, IN location to sign the papers and give deposit. When we got there then that when everything change. He was told that his deposit amount went up by $800 and we accepted the new deposit. After sitting for over 2 and half hours. The sales manager Ken came back and said that CarMax decided not to do business with him. WHAT?? I never heard that before so, we asked why and he said no information was given to him and to call the 800-519-1511 consumer relations."
"I have been trying to find a BMW X6 with specific features and options, and I was able to locate one on a nationwide search in your Roseville, Ca location. This was early Sunday (22nd July) morning, and I was able to put a hold on the vehicle to have it transferred to my location. Next day (Monday 23rd July) when I went to the local CarMax in Mobile, Alabama to pay for the transfer, I was told, the car is being shipped to a different location for someone else."
"Carmax appears to be no different than any other used car lot. I took my 2013 Dodge Ram 1500 to Carmax to get an offer. They offered me 8k. The night before I valued the truck on KBB.com and came up with a trade-in value of 11k, and that was using the ‘good condition’, which the truck is actually in ‘very good condition’. When I questioned the discrepancy between KBB and what Carmax offered, the agent actually went on KBB to see for himself. While he was entering the information, I noticed he entered the sub-model as Tradesman. I told him the truck was not a Tradesman, but an Express. He said according to his appraiser it is a Tradesman. "
